	description = Kerbal scientests used to thought that Bob kerman screams at the back seat when his craft flew pass mach 3. But Wernher believed that Bob was a brave kerbal and he would never scream during flights. He thinks, the sound was caused by a special airframe shape interact with super high speed air. Upon further investigation, Werner published his theory on the 'Scream' effect. OPT's scientests applied this theory to their latest atmospheric propulsion project, although this resulted OPT in bankrupt, but they do now have the first ever ScreamJet! At low speeds, the engine operates as a regular turbojet. However, at higher speeds it screams! For a short period the 'scream' effect takes over which packs a powerful kick. At even higher speeds still, it explodes.
