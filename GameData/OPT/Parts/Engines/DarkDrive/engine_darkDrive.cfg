description = After decades of research and experiments on the Mystery Goo, scientest are now able to refine it into 'Dark Goos' and put it in good use. This new type of goo feeds on rocket fuel and produces something much more interesting. Even though Dark Goo is no longer fictional, the failure rate of refining is still extremely high, making Dark goos one of the rarest and most expensive substance known to Kerbal kind.
