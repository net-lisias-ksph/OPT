OPT v1.9.0:
	- Separated v1.8.6 into two pack: OPT main(v1.9.0) and OPT legacy(v1.0).
  	  'stali', 'avatar', 'humpback' parts and J-60, J-61, J-81 engines, droptanks are moved to OPT Legacy.
  	  I,J,K fuselage parts are updated and moved to OPT main along with wing parts and 3 engines.
	- Texture update for OPT main, to be more stock alike.
	- Some models are smoothened (at certain angles, some part no longer have different shines to another part)
	- New model for many parts in OPT main.
	- Added JQS
	- Added J Deployment Bay
	- Added J Inline Docking port (small and large)
	- Added J RCS, J RCS drone core
	- Added 3 pre-built crafts
	- Many parts for OPT main moved to their corresponding categories
	- Many parts for OPT main have changed their name to appear more consistent.
	- ILS crew reduced from 5 to 3
	- ISP crew reduced from 5 to 3
	- Part's light now uses the new emission config modules.
	- Increased all liquid fuel tank capacity by 25%
	- Increased J-HT cockpit's fuel capacity by 100%

OPT v1.9.1:
	- Added J Inline Boarding Ramp, J rear boarding ladder, both have a small IVA (in utility section)
	- Added IVA to J-SL, J-HT, J-QS. I wasn't happy with the J crew tank, I will remake it and upload it next patch.
	- ASET prop updated to a version updated by forum user veld (color tag fix)
	- J Aerospike is now under "OPT Propulsion Science Division" manufacturer tab
	- J science lab increased data storage from 500 to 1050
	- Module Lifting Surface's drag values corrected
	- K Spaceplane cockpit's bulkhead profile changed from 'K' to 'k'
	- FSFuelSwitch Mass Discrepancy Error should be fixed
	- In parts config file, part's name have been moved to the top.

OPT v1.9.2
	- Added K 3m Fueltank
	- Added K to Tri 2.5m Engine Mount
	- Added K Space Plane Cockpit's IVA
	- Fixed missing collider for J service bay
	- Fixed unable to EVA from boarding ramp
	- Fixed OPT large, huge pylon and stabilizer a and b's lifting value, they now produce the correct lift (about 3 times more)
	- Added correct drag cube to: J deployment bay, J Cargo Bay, J Service Bay, K Hollow fuselage, K Cargo Bay (this should lower lot's of incorrect drag in some cases)
	- All Cargo bay's lookup radius increased slightly to cover the corners in the cargo bay.
	- Modified K Rear Cargo Ramp's colliders to be less bumpy
	- Fixed "play animation automatically" that caused cargo bays to not shield items inside at launch.
	- Added a dummy animation to K hollow fuselage parts, they now uses module cargo bay and  shields stuff inside properly.
	- Removed J-SL cockpit's 40 mono propellant
	- Fixed K Cockpit's mesh, (above the middle windshield, the mesh was extruding inward)
	- J-SL cockpit now have a pair of built in retrograde RCS thrusters <<----------- should be pretty useful I might consider adding them to other cockpits
	- Stabilizer a and b's max actuation angle lowered from 30 to 20
	- Stock aircraft Balari V SSTO reconfigured slightly (fuel tank positions) , should improve flying when gliding with empty fuel tanks, as well as increased delta V.     
	- J Aerospike's mass increased from 1.21 to 7.26; cost increased from 9k to 11k; ISP at ground reduced from 390 to 380, ISP in space reduced from 420 to 390;
	- OPT's J and K fuselage's lift value rebalanced, j fuselage lift increased by 16%, k fuselage lift increased by 83%.
	- J and K fuselage parts mass increased; J by 10%, K by 20%;
