OPT Reconfig

1.8.0 (WIP)

* All main engines: New plumes. New sounds.
* Added missing lift surface ratings to these engines: HAE-02 Mk2 engine, J Linear aerospike.
* Added surface attach to Mk2 Nose.
* Adjusted Power Sphere fusion selection.
  * Some options are now only available when relevant mods are installed.
  * Removed duplicate LqdHe3 option.
* Adjusted Dark Goo balance.
  * Added mass.
  * Slowed its consumption and production rates.
  * Added immense buffs for Dark Drive to serve as a half-decent interstellar engine.
  * Made Dark Drive incredibly more expensive to match.
* Revised MFT/RealFuels configs.


1.7.0

* Added Rational Resources tank types patch.
* Added boiloff module for OPT CryoTanks. Delete the plugin for it if this feature is not desired.
* Added Subcategories config.
* Fixed duplicate vesseltype keys in cockpits.
* Fixed drag cubes for J body, particularly the inline drone cores and SAS/RCS.
* Fixed Connected Living Space patch:
  * Added parts to this as passable volume was considered in the tank volume re-balance in Reconfig 1.5 ~ 1.6.
* Fixed entries for a 2.5m cockpit in B9PS, WBI, IonCross and CLS integrations.
* Ensured OPT Mk2 intake always has normalized heat tolerance.
* OPT engines become CryoEngines if CryoEngines is installed.
* Updated WarpJet engines to now default to IntakeAir if CRP not installed.


1.6.1

* Fixed Snacks: Air subtype being defined without its tank type/ without Air! enabled.


1.6.0

* Minor engine tuning. ARI engines assume they're in vacuum at 0.1% or 0.001 atm.
* Consolidated and compartmentalized Dark Goo ecosystem. It's now divided across less configs and is easier to delete and disable without breaking things, for players who don't like it.
* Added Ioncross Crew Support (a life support mod favored by other maintainers of OPT Spaceplane).
* Added buff for Kerbal Foundries: Adjustable Landing Gear
* Updated B9PS and WBI integration in accordance with release of Snacks: Air! and Stress!
* Updated B9PS and WBI integration in accordance with internally renaming some Chimera parts and soft-deprecation to avoid breaking craft files. The only thing that can break is Tweakscale configs.
* Fixed B9 tank types for NF Propulsion being declared regardless of NF Propulsion's presence.
* Fixed tank volume balancing. 
  * Avatar and K full tanks now hold double that of hollow tanks (9360 LF).
  * Avatar and K tanks.
  * Bicouplers and tricoupler(s).
  * Avatar, K and Humpback adapters.
  * J and Stail to 2.5m adapters.
* Fixed (removed) potential for BARIS module to add twice to science labs.
* Fixed CRP IntakeAtm-for-all patch not working when planet does not have Oxygen.
* Fixed syntax errors that break the OPT Power Spheres under WBI integration.
* Fixed broken fusion fuel selection for OPT Power Spheres under WBI: Classic Mode.
  * Added several fusion fuel options to OPT Power Spheres under WBI: CRP Mode.
  * Options: Boron, Lithium, Lithium6, LqdDeuterium, LqdHe3, LqdHydrogen, LqdTritium.
  * Xenon option now fully treated as a fallback. Expect to be unable to use it in most cases.

1.5.0

* Added 1 deg of gimbal to Dark Drive.
* Found/added B9 mesh switch in OPT 'Stail' Class to 2.5m Adapter.

Big Balance Pass
- - - - - -
* Raised heat resistance in J "heat resistant" nose and Mk2 nose.
* Buffed most tank volumes (as measured with stock fuel tanks and WBI Mule MLM. They now largely hold 2x the usual amounts and have comparable dry/wet ratios to stock tanks. This will upset, though not break, many craft). OPT is also now much more usable with Nertea's CryoTanks and CryoEngines.
* Cockpits now hold much less fuel. They were excessive.
* All RCS performance balanced and now use Plume Party "Soyuz" RCS FX.
* K Tricoupler no longer holds fuel.
* Nerfed tankage in all inline RCS and aeroydynamic RCS clusters. They were quite excessive.

WBI integration
- - - - - -
* Update the template decal links following WBI decal revamp for KSP 1.7.
  * Added decal for SAS/Gyro template.
* OPT Reconfig will appear in play mode switcher UI.
* Fusion Power Spheres can switch input resources via WBI.
* Added cryo fuel options.
* Added Casa/Ponderosa templates to the following parts: J Cabin, Humpback Cabin.
* Added OmniShop and OmniWorks to the following parts. The use of tanks for this are a take on the "wet workshop" concept:
  * Avater cockpit adapter and Avatar tank
  * K 6m tank
  * J cabin and J 4m tank
  * Stail 4m tank
  * H inline tanks
  * Humpback cabin


1.3.3.1

* Adjusted versioning urls.


1.3.3

* Adjustments to Dark Drive/ Dark Goo config.
* CTT for OPT Power Spheres.


1.3.2

* un-broke OPT ARI-75 quick response (2nd engine mode) in vacuum.

1.3.1

* Nerfed leading edge drag on all OPT Main Wing elevons. No more open airbrake levels of drag at zero AoA from these things
* Revised USI modules config thanks to Nicky21
* Changed default tank setting on droptanks (in WBI mode) from Oxidizer to LiquidFuel

1.3

* Re-evaluated some bulkhead profiles:
  * "i" parts are now in "size2"
  * "juno" parts go to "j"
* Added CCK-style custom bulkhead profiles
* Added non-spool secondary mode to ARI-75 engine (for vacuum friendly operation)
* Slight increase to Dark Drive's RTG output

1.2.5

* Anti-collision for Modular Fuel Tanks.
* Adjusted cryo tank ratios to playable levels, half of the suggested values by, and thanks to Sresk.
* Nerf USI recyclers for J cabin, added recyclers to J, Stail, Avatar cockpits.
* Removed flameout plume on HAE-02 engine. Scaling problem makes it as a flashbang and a health hazard.

1.2.4

* Added XenonGas to NFPropulsion tank types.
* Buffed Lithium tankage (maybe by too much. Untested).
* Added MonoPropellant tank option to all tanks/parts.

* Moved HAE-02 Mk2 engine to Aerospace Tech in tech tree
* Buffed WBI storage capacity (x4)

* OPT parts will gain/use Atmosphere resource and not IntakeAtm simply if Pathfinder is installed
* Added radiators to all cargo bays and hollow fuselage except ramps/tails
* Remove second lift surface module from a 2.5m cockpit
