Once you have done the above or new OPT user, then:

Drag downloaded .zip file to your ksp directory (same folder as KSP.exe)
Rightclick the .zip file, select "extract here" option.
Choose to replace all if your unsure about your Firespitter/ModuleManager/ASET/RasterPropMonitor versions.

If you are experienced with modding, just drag the "OPT" folder inside your zip file's GameData folder, and place it to
your GameData folder.
Note that OPT requires ModuleManager, and OPT works better with Firespitter plugin and interstellarFuelSwitch.
Everything else such as ASET folder and JSI is for cockpit internal only, is not required.
